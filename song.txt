Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight)
(Seven, six) Commencing (Five) countdown
Engines on (Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One)
And may God's love (Lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
